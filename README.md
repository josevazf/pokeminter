<p align="center">A responsive Pokedex dApp that allows users to search for and mint each detailed Pokemon Card as an NFT</p>

## üëÅÔ∏è Overview
This project was built using React (create-react-app with typescript), Axios to fetch data from the PokeApi, MUI components to ease up on the UI creation, RainbowKit to provide the ‚ÄúConnect Pok√©dex‚Äù button (aka wallet), Wagmi to glue the frontend with the EVM, and some scripts to automatically generate the Pokemon SVG‚Äôs and metadata JSON files.
The NFT contracts where developed according to the ERC721URIStorage standard implementation with a little twist to limit the Pok√©mon NFT minting to 1 of each per wallet. They were deployed on Sepolia and Sepolia Base testnets.

The number of Pok√©mons rendered is limited to 151 (considering these the OG's) and also because all of them are rendered on each load of the page, this is something to work on and updgrade later on.
There is a search bar that filters the Pok√©mons showed based on the input text.

Main UI was developed using MUI components and RainbowKit to provide the Connect button.

The Pok√©mon Detailed Cards design was picked up from an AMAZING template created and published by [@ricardohs](https://www.figma.com/@ricardohs) on Figma. This was then translated into HTML code, so it could be rendered on the page with each Pokemon's updated information. To create the NFTS, this template was also converted to SVG (with no text outlines) which allowed the inclusion of input variables to later be updated with the Pok√©mon information, and batch create all desired Pok√©mon cards with a script. To complement, this script also creates the metadata.json files that will compose each NFT card, also populating it with the Pok√©mon information.
